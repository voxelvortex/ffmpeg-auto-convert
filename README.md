# ffmpeg Auto Converter

This is a quick little utility that will automatically convert files to h265 encoded mp4 videos. I have a bunch of old family videos I wanted to convert, this utility makes that easy

# Usage

If you'd like to use this yourself, you can edit the docker-compose to point at a different folder, or move all your video files into a folder called "data" within the same directory as this repo. Then run:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

and wait for everything to be done :D
